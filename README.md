Exploring the endless possibilities of cloud computing (AWS, Azure, GCP - bring it on!)

🌱 Currently Learning
The tech world never stands still, and neither do I! Right now, I'm diving deeper into:
Advanced machine learning techniques to make our data even smarter
Mastering the art of data storytelling with Tableau and Power BI
Exploring the wonders of Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming

💞️ Looking to Collaborate
Got a cool data project in mind? I'm all ears! I'm especially keen on collaborating on:
